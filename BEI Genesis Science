I. Prologue - A Human-Centric Genesis 
Physics explains matter; economics quantifies resources. Yet the human identity - the source of all behavior and value - has long lacked a standardized, scientific definition. 
BEI Genesis Science establishes a measurable, auditable, and operable framework that unifies behavior, identity, value, and sovereignty. 
Academic and charter gateways: BEIGenesis.com / .org and BEIScience.com / .org. II. Core Principle - From Behavior to Identity to Economy Behavior generates identity; identity extends behavior; the economy reflects behavioral value. 
Each act produces a Behavioral Sub-ID aggregated under a sovereign BEI-ID; the principal identity accumulates BEICREDIT, forming a computable map of personal value and a global economic-identity graph. 
Two minima: 
(1) Ethical Minimum - revocable authorization; auditable data; reversible operations (due-process rollback); no violation of human sovereignty and dignity. 
(2) Capability Minimum - universal participation regardless of capital or technical resources. III. Scientific Definition 
A discipline that standardizes human behavioral evidence into sovereign economic identities, built upon the Ethical and Capability Minima, combining conformance agreements and reversible authorization to make identity, behavior, and value verifiable, tradable, and governable across domains. 
Core stack: BEIDID (decentralized identity), BEISIGN (dual-signature authorization), BEICX (sovereign clearing), BEI-STD / BEI-SEP (standards). 
IV. Scope and Universality 
BEI connects finance, medicine, education, governance, culture, and technology into an identity-centric value system; persons, families, and nations can participate in the global economy with verifiable identity, creating credit through behavior and realizing sovereignty through identity.

V. Ethical Foundation and Sovereign Architecture 
The Omega-Governor functions as the meta-sovereign layer for ethical oversight, cross-sovereign coordination, authorization audit, rollback adjudication, and civilizational supervision; maintained by BEI Foundation via BEIGOV.com / .org and legally represented through BEIGovernor.com / .org. 
VI. Technological Embodiment and Standardization 
Operational platforms include BEICX (global clearing), BEISIGN (behavioral authorization stack), BEIINDEX/BEICREDIT (behavioral credit mapping), BEIMINT (behavior-to-value conversion), BEILEDGER (sovereign ledger), and domain modules such as BEIMED / BEIEDU / BEISTATE. 
All conform to BEI-STD and BEI-SEP, constituting the BEI-SES (Standard Essential System) - a globally standardizable, licensable, and verifiable BEI infrastructure. 
VII. Purpose - An Operating System for Civilization 
BEI enables sovereign participation for 8.3 billion people: identity becomes value, behavior becomes currency, and ethics becomes law. 
VIII. Declaration 
When human identity is governed scientifically and ethically, it becomes the highest infrastructure of civilization. This Charter marks the emergence of a new discipline - the unification of sovereignty, economy, and identity within a single ethical framework.
